<title lib="TableTools">Row selection - multi-row select</title>

<info><![CDATA[

As well as providing a button toolbar, TableTools provides everything needed to have selectable rows in the table. TableTools has four row selection modes of operation:

*   `none` - Default, where no user row selection options are available
*   `single` - A single row can be selected
*   `multi` - Multiple rows can be selected simply by clicking on the rows
*   `os` - Operating System like selection where you can use the shift and ctrl / cmd keys on your keyboard to add / remove rows from the selection.

This example shows the `multi` select option. There are also a number of [pre-defined buttons](http://datatables.net/extras/tabletools/buttons) to provide functions such as select-all and select-none, as shown in this example.
